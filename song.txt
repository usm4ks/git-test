I've been tryna call,
I've been on my own for long enough,
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe.
I'm going through withdrawals,
You don't even have to do too much,
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby!

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty, (Oh)
No one's around to judge me, (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone.

I said, “Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights!
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch.”
I said, “Ooh, I'm drowning in the night!
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust.”
Hey, hey, hey!

I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky,
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh!

The city's cold and empty, (Oh)
No one's around to judge me, (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone.

I said, “Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights!
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch.”
I said, “Ooh, I'm drowning in the night!
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust.”

I'm just walking by to let you know, (By to let you know)
I can never say it on the phone, (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time. (Ooh)

I said, “Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights!
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch.”
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

I said, “Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights!
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch.”









Yeah
Shawty, I know what you need
I got everything you need
I promise I ain't gonna hold out neither
I'ma give it all to you baby
It's burnin' on, bust it

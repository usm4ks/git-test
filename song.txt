I've been tryna call,
I've been on my own for long enough,
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe.
I'm going through withdrawals,
You don't even have to do too much,
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby!

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty, (Oh)
No one's around to judge me, (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone.

I said, “Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights!
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch.”
I said, “Ooh, I'm drowning in the night!
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust.”
Hey, hey, hey!
